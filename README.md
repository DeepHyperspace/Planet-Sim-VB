This is a simple Application that to show for beginners what you can do with object orientated programming. 
Every Planet has properties with diffrent values.
Physical formulars simulate the planets around the sun, you can speed up or slow down their movement.
You can zoom in and out. This simulation is only 2-Dimensional.
