# Planet-Sim-VB
A simple programming example using OOP techniques to simulate our solar system.

By understanding this code, you will learn how to write a simple .NET Application. Every Planet has properties with different values. Physical formulas simulate the planets around the sun, you can speed up or slow down their movement. You can zoom in and out. This simulation is only 2-Dimensional.

You can add additional planets or other objects like asteroids with a high eccentricity. You will see how they speed up near the sun and slow down when they get far away.

# Additional notes

All classes are located in the file SimObjects.vb

Have fun.
